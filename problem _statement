# File Handling & Final Project
# 📚 Theory Concepts:
# File Operations: Reading from and writing to different file types
# Text Files: Working with .txt files for simple data storage
# CSV Files: Handling comma-separated values for structured data
# Error Handling: Managing file-related errors gracefully
# Context Managers: Using 'with' statement for proper resource management
# Code Organization: Structuring projects into multiple files and modules
# Debugging Techniques: Advanced debugging for file operations
# 🛠️ Hands-On Practice:
# Create a program that saves user data to a text file
# Build a simple diary/notes application with file storage
# Read and process data from CSV files
# Create a quiz game that saves scores to a file
# Build a to-do list that persists between program runs
# Practice handling different file-related errors
# Organize code into multiple modules
# 🎯 Project: Personal Finance Tracker
# Build a complete personal finance tracker that allows users to add expenses, categorize them, save data to files, and generate monthly reports. This final project combines all concepts from Weeks 1-4 into a practical, real-world application.

# 🛠️ Technical Requirements:
# Implement file operations for data persistence (JSON/CSV)
# Create a modular code structure with separate modules
# Add comprehensive error handling for file operations
# Implement data validation for all inputs
# Generate reports with statistics and visualizations
# Support multiple expense categories
# Add search and filter functionality
# Create a user-friendly menu system
# Implement backup and data recovery features
# 📋 Step-by-Step Guide:
# Step 1: Project Architecture
# • Create main project folder with subfolders for modules
# • Design data structure for expenses
# • Plan file formats for data storage
# • Create module structure: main.py, expenses.py, file_handler.py, reports.py
# Step 2: Core Data Module
# • Create Expense class with attributes (date, amount, category, description)
# • Add validation methods for expense data
# • Create ExpenseManager class to handle collections of expenses
# • Implement methods to add, remove, and search expenses
# Step 3: File Handling Module
# • Create functions to save/load expenses to JSON file
# • Implement backup functionality
# • Add CSV export/import features
# • Handle file errors (missing files, permission errors, etc.)
# Step 4: Reports Module
# • Create monthly summary reports
# • Generate category-wise expense breakdown
# • Add expense trend analysis
# • Create basic text-based visualizations
# Step 5: Main Application
# • Build user-friendly menu system
# • Integrate all modules
# • Add data validation at user interface level
# • Implement search and filter functionality
# Step 6: Advanced Features
# • Add budget setting and tracking
# • Implement recurring expenses
# • Add expense prediction based on history
# • Create data export to multiple formats
# Step 7: Testing & Polish
# • Test all file operations with edge cases
# • Verify data persistence between runs
# • Test error handling scenarios
# • Add documentation and help system
